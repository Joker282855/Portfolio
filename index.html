                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Provo, Utah. I have four older brothers and one older sister
                    which makes me the youngest member in my family. Hobbies include coding, reading books,
                    snow skiing, and spending time with my family. I will have six months of coding experience
                    by September. I have been on the deans list every single semester at Utah Valley University
                    and will be graduating in Spring 2022 with a Bacherlors in Mathematics.
