# Website Description:
My first job as a full stack web developer with emphasis in backend end web development will be after I get hired by a company. Because of that I do not have lots of experience underneath my belt yet. The problem the protfolio solves is showing employers that I have experience with mulitple languages and software that is used to build fullstack websites that use a backend database. Employers will see that I am a person who knows and understands how to use the tools associated with making full stack websites after looking at my portfolio.

# Website Organization: 
Since this challenge did not involve using a database I used the index.htlm file to organize the layout of the portfolio. The stye.css file was used to implement the design elements that are aparrent when viewing my protfolio and to make it user responsive for ipads/phones. I was able to make the portfolio user friendly by using media queires on the CSS file. The portfolio is designed with a header at the top that has my name and links to the different sections of the portfolio. The sections of the portfolio are an about me section, my work, and contact information. The about me section has a picture of myself and a few paragraphs that describe my hobbies, intrests, and facts about my family. My work section highlights the different projects along with challenges that highlihgt my skills at using different tools to make frontend websites or fullstack applications. The contact information section has the information a person can use to get in touch with me if they like the work showcased on my portfolio.
